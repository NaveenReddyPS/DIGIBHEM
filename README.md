# DIGIBHEM
The NumberGuessingGame is a simple Java program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. The user is given Ten tries to guess the number. If the user correctly guesses the number within the given tries, the program outputs a message indicating the "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number You Win". Otherwise, the program outputs a message indicating the "Sorry, you ran out of guesses along with the correct number".

# DOCUMENTATION
This is a Java program for a number guessing game, where the program generates a random number between 1 to 100, and the user has to guess the number within 10 tries. The program prompts the user to enter their guess, and provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low.

To use this program, you can compile the code using a Java compiler and then run the compiled class file. When the program runs, it will prompt the user to enter their guess, and provide feedback on whether the guess was correct or not. If the user guesses correctly within 10 tries, the program will print "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number You Win", otherwise it will print "Sorry, you ran out of guesses along with the correct number"s along with the correct number.

This program uses a while loop to iterate through the user's guesses, and decrements the number of trials after each guess. If the user guesses the number correctly, the loop is broken and the program prints "You Win!". If the user runs out of tries without guessing the correct number, the program prints "You lose!" along with the correct number.
